# TougherSurvival

This is a Minecraft 1.21.0 datapack. This datapack is motivated by unbalanced mob mechanics pointed out in the Jay Exci's YouTube video "Minecraft is Bad (at survival)" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A1w-Y_Wv5U)

My idea is to increase the follow range to 50 blocks and base armor protection and double the movement speed and attack damage.

I used implementation ideas from novomiracle's "minecraft but a bit harder" datapack: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/minecraft-but-a-bit-harder/
